# QuerySense: Natural Language to SQL Converter & Database Query Tool

End-to-end Streamlit application enables seamless conversion of natural language queries into SQL (Structured Query Language) queries, along with querying an SQLite database. Leveraging the Gemini-pro API for language model capabilities, it offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with databases using plain English queries.

## Features:

- **Natural Language Interface**: Easily input queries in everyday language and let the application handle translation into SQL.
- **End-To-End Solution**: From inputting text queries to fetching results from the database, this app provides a comprehensive solution.
- **Database Compatibility**: Compatible with SQLite databases, ensuring easy integration and demonstration.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for smooth navigation and interaction.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Utilizes efficient algorithms for quick conversion and retrieval of results.

## How to Use:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal to run the application locally:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Input Text Query**: Enter your query in natural language format into the provided text input field.

3. **Translate**: Click on the 'Translate' button to convert your text query into SQL.

4. **Execute Query**: Once the translation is complete, execute the SQL query to retrieve results from the connected SQLite database.

5. **View Results**: The results will be displayed within the application interface for easy access.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Backend server environment and application logic.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Gemini-pro API**: Leveraged for language model capabilities.
- **SQLite**: SQL database for demonstration purposes.
